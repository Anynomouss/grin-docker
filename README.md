# Grin Docker images

(Internal developer documentation for now)

* base-build contains a Dockerfile for a minimal grin docker image
* scripts will contain any handy scripts for working with docker
* testnet contains a docker-compose project for building and deploying a full testnet. Further details within that directory.
* devnet builds something similar to the example in grin/doc/build.md, and contains example shell scripts to perform transaction from different running nodes

Some notes on running docker and docker-compose are in [build.md](build.md)
